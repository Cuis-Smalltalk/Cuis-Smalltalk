This directory contains miscellaneous other files not directly used by
SCOWL.

It currently contains list of various taboo words.

The file "profane.1" contains vulgar or swear words which should
generally not be said around children.  The file "profane.3" contains
words which are considered vulgar, offensive, or taboo by some
dictionaries, but are not nearly as strong as those in "profane.1",
and generally not considered swear words today.

The file "offensive.1" contains extremely offensive racial slurs which
should generally not be used.  The file "offensive.2" contains
offensive racial slurs which should, also, in general, not be used but
don't have the stigma in modern society as those in "offensive.1".
