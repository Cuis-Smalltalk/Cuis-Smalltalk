7.1: January 6, 2011

  Updated to SCOWL 7.1 which corrected several errors and also added
  several now common proper names and some other words now in
  common use.

7.0: December 27, 2010

  Updated to SCOWL 7 which was created with a new version of Varcon
  which corrected many errors, especially in the British and Canadian
  dictionaries.  Numerous other corrections are also included.

  Added en_CA-variant_* and en_GB-variant_* auxiliary dictionaries.

6.0: August 10, 2004

  Updated to SCOWL 6 which avoided using the original Ispell
  dictionaries as they were a source of too many errors, among other
  changes.
  
  Added en_GB-ize dictionary (British with "ize" spelling).

  Added en-variant_* auxiliary dictionaries.

  Avoided using the strip-accents options since Aspell 0.60 no longer
  supports it.

  Added affix support for the aspell6 package.  Affix compression is
  not used though.

0.51-0: January 3, 2003

  Updated to SCOWL 5 which:

    Added variants that were not really spelling variants (such as
    forwards)

    Removed some spelling variants and other strange words from the
    word list (for example meaneing).

    Removed rarely used inflections of a word.

    Removed the DEC Word List due to the questionable license and
    because removing it will not seriously decrease the quality of SCOWL
    (there are a few less proper names).

    Among others.
