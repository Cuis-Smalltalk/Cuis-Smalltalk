This directory contains the scripts to create speller dictionaries for
Hunspell and Aspell.  It is only supported if ran from a released
version of SCOWL unpacked from a tar file or from checked out from
SVN.  Do not attempt to run these scripts if you unpacked SCOWL from
the a zip file: the required symbolic links will be missing and the
files will have DOS EOL characters.
