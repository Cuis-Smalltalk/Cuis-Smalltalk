                      THE ENABLE2K "PLURAL REFORM"
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹


All dictionaries, it would seem, have a "How to Use This Dictionary"
section which assures the reader that, whenever a noun has an irregular or
possibly confusing plural, all plurals will be explicitly stated in the
corresponding entry.  In practice, all dictionaries routinely ignore this
promise.  The result is that there are many nouns for which a correct
plural or plurals cannot easily be determined, and one who wishes to do so
is reduced to guesswork and pattern-matching.

This fact of life has been a constant irritation during the compilation
of ENABLE.  Midway into the compilation of ENABLE2K, I decided I'd really
had enough of dealing with this in a piecemeal way.  I decided instead to
undertake a thorough study of the entire "plural situation", by gathering
information in one place about every listed noun lacking complete plural
information.  Ultimately, a data base of around 800 words requiring careful
consideration was compiled; many other words were given a more superficial
examination.  A side effect of this crusade was the discovery of a number
of plurals unnoted in previous versions of ENABLE whose correctness was
very well documented.

Kinds of words for which the correct plural might be in doubt include:

1.  Scientific and technical words (e.g., paralysis).
2.  Words of foreign origin (e.g., tableau).
3.  Words ending in "f", "s" or "z" (e.g., asparagus).
4.  Words ending in "o" (e.g., tomato).
5.  Words with a collective meaning or unusual usage patterns (e.g.,
    jailbait, dickens).
6.  Words similar to other words with irregular plurals (e.g., mongoose,
    shaman).

To complicate matters, it is clear that dictionary writers omit plurals
for a number of different reasons, including:

1.  The word has a regular English plural, and the compilers do not
    anticipate any difficulties (e.g., circus).
2.  The word's plural(s) can be predicted from the plural of a suffix
    or ending word from which the word is formed (e.g., airman,
    psychoanalysis).
3.  The word is of a sort for which the plural form is not often used
    (e.g., diabetes).
4.  The plural was carelessly omitted.  (Few examples can be proven,
    but, after all, lexicographers are human too.  One clear example is
    the omission of any plural for the word "flanken" by OSPD (r),
    which is the *only* case I've found where OSPD fails to keep its
    vow to explicitly state all inflections, or the lack thereof.)

Whenever words of the classes listed above are shown in some of the
source dictionaries without an explicit plural, a decision was needed as
to which plurals to include in ENABLE2K and its supplemental lists.
Attempting to codify binding rules for these decisions, though a useful
exercise in recognizing English word patterns, was not adequate to solve
the problem.  After failing to establish ironclad rules for plural
determination, I have gradually developed a number of rules of thumb,
including:

1.  Any plural given in OSPD is taken on face value.  OSPD was based
on several out-of-print dictionaries, and the fact that I can find no
current source for a particular plural is not particularly germane.

2.  In the absence of any other information, technical words of Latin or
Greek origin are assumed to have only a Latin/Greek plural.  (Exceptions
are chemical elements, for which OSPD clearly establishes that plurals are
English-standard, and the names of species, where Latinate plurals are
uncommon, though not unheard-of.)  This rule is based in part on the
observed fact that such plurals are regularly omitted from dictionaries,
but can generally be readily intuited by the scientifically literate
reader.  Note that this rule carries somewhat more force for scientific and
medical terms than for the vocabulary of fields like grammar, architecture
and theology.  Also, it carries more weight for a word that "looks Greek"
than for one whose foreignness is not obvious to the eye.

3.  A corollary of the above rule is that words with certain suffixes can
safely be assumed to have regular Greek or Latin plurals, which most
dictionaries are likely to omit.  Words ending in -genesis, -iasis,
-lysis, -osis, -stasis and -taxis, in particular, can be assumed to have
plurals in which the "is" is changed to "es", unless another plural is
explicitly shown.

4.  In the absence of other information (such as formation from a suffix
like -man, with its own pluralization patterns), non-technical words
are assumed to have regular English plurals, even if another plural, such
as a foreign plural, is plausible.  This is based in part on the idea that
the dictionary cannot expect its readers to know a variety of non-English
languages, and so is failing them if it neglects to give explicit foreign
plurals.  Thus, when AHD3 gives no explicit plural for the word "sastruga",
this must be a claim that "sastrugas" is a legitimate plural, since the
alternative is to suppose that its compilers assumed all readers would be
familiar enough with Russian (and its transliteration into the Roman
alphabet) to guess the plural "sastrugi" instead. As another example,
someone who looks up the word "arras" and finds no plural listed has no
reason to suppose the plural is anything but "arrases", which we list in
the ENABLE2K supplement despite the fact that one dictionary (MW10) shows
only an explicit plural of "arras".  An exception to this rule is that any
really appalling regular English plural will be rejected ("appalling" as
measured by the ENABLE compilers, of course).  An example is the plural
of "manyplies".  The failure of any source dictionary to show an explicit
plural for this word would otherwise imply a plural of "manyplieses", but
this construct so clashes with English word patterns as to be rejected on
that basis.

(It should be noted for the record that, unlike AHD3, AHD4 gives an
explicit plural of "sastrugi" for "sastruga".  The word "hafiz", for
which MW10 gives only the plural "hafis", but about which the other major
dictionaries are silent, is perhaps now a better example.)

5.  Suffix-based plurals are given more weight if they are confirmed by
explicit plurals.  The fact that -man words pluralize in -men is well-
confirmed.  The MW10 entry for -osis says it pluralizes in either -oses
or -osises, but in fact an explicit plural of -osises is seldom seen.
For this reason, we allow an -osises plural only if explicitly shown in
one of the source dictionaries.  Finally, consider the suffix -enchyma.
This is shown as having two plurals, -enchymas and -enchymata.  We
reluctantly accept both plurals, the reluctance stemming from the fact
that not a single word so suffixed is listed anywhere with an explicit
plural.  This lack lends more credibility to the natural plural form.
But since the suffix plural is the only piece of explicit information we
have, we have no better option than to believe it, and list both plurals.

6.  For help in resolving difficult cases, the ENABLE2K compilers have
used a few secondary sources of additional information.  These are the
Random House Unabridged Dictionary, the Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary,
the list of accepted words in British Scrabble(r) (OSW), and the list of
words accepted by the Hasbro computer Scrabble game.  The Merriam-Webster
Medical Dictionary was especially valuable for finding plurals of
biological and medical words, not least because this dictionary is far
more explicit about pluralization than any of the general-purpose
dictionaries.  When MWMD shows no explicit plural for "bronchitis", one
feels safe in assuming that it regards "bronchitises" as the only plural.
If "bronchites" or "bronchitides" were considered acceptable, I feel
certain MWMD would have made explicit mention of them.


ENABLE2K is comprised of a main word list (short words from OSPD and
long words from MW10), plus a number of additional lists.  When, as a
result of this research, new plurals were found or previously recorded
plurals were invalidated, there remained the issue of how to record the
changes.  When plurals were invalidated, there was no choice but to remove
them from the main list.  Invalid plurals were almost exclusively plurals
of diseases.  In a few cases, on the authority of MWMD, a new disease
plural was added directly to the main list.  This was especially necessary
when all the previously recorded plurals for a disease had been removed.
Beyond this, if a new plural was implied by an entry in MW10, the plural
was added to the MW10ADD list.  For long words, if a plural was listed or
implied by two other dictionaries (of the five used by ENABLE), it was
added to the 2DICTS list.  Similarly, for short words, any plural listed
or implied by a single source dictionary was added to the OSPDADD list.
Finally, all new plurals which were not placed directly into the main list
were added to the file PLURALS.LST.  This includes plurals of long words
only noted by a single source as well as irregular plurals which are
documented by no dictionary (other than OSW), but about which we are
highly confident, such as "mimeses".

Note that the discussion above applies only to plurals which were added
for words already recognized as nouns.  It does not apply to any plural
added for a word which was previously recognized only as an adjective or
interjection.  For instance, the word "mutuals", the plural of a word
which is described by OSPD as an adjective, is not present in PLURALS.LST.

As stated above, detailed information was collected on 800 words, giving
all possible reasonable (and sometimes unreasonable) plurals, together
with the reasons for accepting them.  It is very unlikely that many
readers would find this data anything other than an exercise in boredom.
But I do think it worthwhile to list the final results, in terms of words
removed from the list and words added.  In most cases, decisions about
whether or not to include a possible plural were clear-cut.  In some
cases, such decisions were very much subject to debate, and I have chosen
to risk boring my audience by describing these situations.  Readers with
less than obsessive interest in the subject may well wish to stop reading
at this point.

(I have chosen only to give data on plurals for words whose singular form
is present in the main ENABLE2K word list.  However, similar decisions
were also required for the plurals of words in the supplemental lists, and
were made in the same way, for the same kinds of reasons.)

The following purported plurals were removed from WORD.LST because no
adequate justification could be found for including them.

amyloidosises
appendicites
appendicitides
ariboflavinosises
babesiosises

As a general rule, additional plurals were added to an appropriate
supplemental list rather than  to the main list.  However, a few were
added directly to WORD.LST.  With one exception (salpiglossises), these
were all plurals of medical terms supported by the MW Medical Dictionary.
These additional plurals are:

arteritides
carditides
gastritises
pronephroi
salpiglossises
tsutsugamushis
uveitides
vaginitides
vulvovaginitides

The following plurals were explicitly mentioned by two dictionaries (for
long words), or by one (for short words).  Because the evidence for these
plurals is unequivocal, they were all added to the main ENABLE list as
"signature words" (see SIGWORD.DOC) unless they were also present in the
new MW10 words list (MW10ADD.LST).  Entries in this list marked with an
asterisk are new to the first revision of the ENABLE2K supplement, and
are not signature words, as the signature words were not changed for this
revision.

Determining the plurals for the following words was not completely
obvious, and there is room for disagreement with my conclusions.  However,
I am reasonably confident that I made the right choices.  Because of the
potent for controversy, I am giving information about cases where plurals
were not added as well as ones in which they were.  In the lists below,
a "=" precedes a plural listed in the previous version of ENABLE which I
retained, a "!" indicates a potential plural which was not added, a "+"
indicates a plural which was added, and a "-" indicates a previously
accepted plural which was rejected.

(During the work on this revision of ENABLE2K, two further words with
questionable plurals turned up.  These words were overlooked in the
investigations described in the document.  The status quo for these
words is not outrageous, so I have not made the attempt to resolve
them at this time.  These words are:

avoirdupois
   !avoirdupois, =avoirdupoises
flak
   =flak, !flaks
)

Finally, we have the list of difficult cases.  These are the words for
which I found decisions far from obvious, and where I think a reasonable
reviewer might have good cause to question my conclusions.  For each
potential plural, in additional to the marks described above, a "?" is
used to indicate those plurals that are dubious, and a brief debate is
given on the merits of accepting or rejecting the plural.  A * marks the
"winning" side to such debates (which is almost always the last side to
speak).  In some cases, you may well find the losing side of the debate
more eloquent or convincing.  You may also find these decisions to be
inconsistent, and that evidence for a plural adequate in one case was
found inadequate in another.  Life is like that sometimes.

aerenchyma
   =aerenchymas, +?aerenchymata

   Con: I have found no evidence at all for the use of "aerenchymata".
  *Pro: MW10 shows that one plural of -enchyma is -enchymata.  In
        practice, "aerenchyma" (a sort of tissue) is a word very
        unlikely to be used in the plural, regular or not, so why
        not accept the one slightly relevant piece of evidence we've
        got?

   =allodia, +?allodiums
alodium
   =alodia, +?alodiums

   Con: "allodium" is a technical legal term, for which one expects
        a Latin plural, as shown by OSPD and RHWCD.
  *Pro: "allodiums" is listed by OSW, and implied by WNW4.

alphosis
   =alphosises, +?alphoses

   Con: OSPD says "alphosises" is the only plural of "alphosis".
  *Pro: "alphosis" is a medical term.  For it not to have an -oses
        plural would be highly surprising.

apomixis
   =apomixes, +?apomixises

   Con: As a scientific word, "apomixis" should be assumed to have only
        a Latinate plural.  Further, neither OSW nor OSPD lists
        "apomixises".
  *Pro: There is little consistency to the way that dictionaries list
        plurals for words ending in -mixis.  Given the failure to show
        an explicit plural of "apomixis" by several of the source
        dictionaries, and the fact that a plural ending in -mixises is
        listed, or even preferred, for other such words, it seems best
        to accept such a plural here as well.  A close call.

arteritis
   =?arteritides, +arteritises

   Con: I can find no sign of acceptance of "arteritides", except...
  *Pro: According to the web pages describing TWL98, it accepts the
        validity of "arteritides". Since the Merriam-Webster crew was
        involved with defining TWL98, there may be something to it.

asperges
   =asperges, !?aspergeses

   Pro: None of the source dictionaries indicate that "asperges" is
        irregular.
  *Con: It is most unusual for words ending in -es (pronounced "eez")
        to add another -es for the plural.  ("herculeses" is an
        exception.)

behoof
   !?behoofs, =behooves

   Pro: Most of the source dictionaries do not show a special plural
        for "behoof", and OSW lists "behoofs".
  *Con: There is substantial documentation for "behooves" as the only
        plural.  This is a very close call.

bris
   !?brises, =brisses

   Pro: None of the source dictionaries (other than OSPD) show an
        irregular plural, leading to a strong implication of the
        correctness of "brises".
  *Con: OSPD shows only "brisses", and, to my eye, "brisses" seems
        much more natural.

calo
   =calo, +?calos

   Con: With so little evidence, there's no point in trying to second-
        guess OSPD.  Failure of MW10 to list a plural is probably
        an oversight, or an indication of the lack of use of the plural.
  *Pro: Because one expects irregular plurals for -o words, dictionaries
        tend to list explicit plurals somewhat more often than for other
        sorts of words.  Accordingly, failure to list a plural for one is
        stronger evidence of regularity than in the general case.

cementum
   =cementa, +?cementums

   Con: One expects "cementum", as a medical term, to have a Latinate
        plural.
  *Pro: So why doesn't any dictionary (other than OSPD and OSW)
        document "cementa"?

cestos
   =cestoi, +?cestoses

   Con: Another case of almost no evidence.  But RHWCD lists "cestos" as
        a variant of "cestus", whose plural is "cesti".  This leads one
        to expect a Latin/Greek plural for "cestos" as well.
  *Pro: But RHWCD could say so, and it doesn't.  Further, "cestoses" is
        in OSW.

charisma
   !?charismas, =charismata

   Pro: Can you imagine Dan Rather contrasting the "charismata" of
        the various presidential hopefuls?
  *Con: But virtually all my sources are convinced "charismata" is
        the only accepted plural.

chlorenchyma
   =chlorenchymas, +?chlorenchymata

   See "aerenchyma".

collenchyma
   =collenchymas, +?collenchymata

   See "aerenchyma".

departed
   =departed, !?departeds

   Pro: There are precedents for this construction, such as "marrieds"
        and "insureds".
  *Con: But "departeds" just doesn't ring true.

dihedron
   +?dihedra, =dihedrons

  *Pro: Anyone who studied geometry in high school knows the preferred
        plural for -hedron is -hedra.  And OSW lists "dihedra".
   Con: The listings in the primary dictionaries for the other -hedron
        words give explicit -hedra plurals.  The absence of such listings
        for "dihedron" is strong evidence against "dihedra".

dynein
   =dynein, +?dyneins

   Con: Very little evidence here, as the word is listed only in OSPD
        and MW10.  Best to trust OSPD.
  *Pro: "dynein", a chemical name, is just not the sort of word one
        expects to be its own plural.

ecesis
   +?eceses, =ecesises

  *Pro: "ecesis" is a technical term, clearly of Greek origin, exactly
        the sort of word one expects to have a -ses plural.
   Con: OSPD says it's "ecesises", and I can't find any actual evidence
        to overrule it.

ed
   =ed, +?eds

   Con: In many contexts, "education" is a collective noun that doesn't
        pluralize, and that "ed" should have the same property is quite
        reasonable.
  *Pro: But it's not obviously so, especially when no non-Scrabble
        dictionary mentions it.

endomixis
   +?endomixes, =?endomixises

   Con: Only OSPD and OSW say anything about plurals for this word.
        There aren't enough -mixis words to establish a pattern.  For
        the other -mixis words, MW10 lists a -mixes plural, but for
        "endomixis" it does not.  This serves as evidence for
        "endomixises".
  *Pro: The "endomixes" plural is clearly more natural.  OSW lists both
        plurals, which seems like a reasonable solution.

enosis
   !?enoses, =enosises

   Pro: "enosis" is derived from Greek, and OSW shows "enoses" as the
        plural.
  *Con: "enosis" comes from modern, not ancient Greek, and is a
        political rather than a scientific term, which makes the
        absence of the usual -oses plural more plausible.

fractus
   =fracti, !?fractuses

   Pro: WNW fails to give an explicit plural for "fractus".  Since WNW
        is the only source dictionary listing this word, all the evidence
        we have points to a regular English plural.
  *Con: Other cloud names have only Latinate plurals.  Also, since
        "fractus" is listed in only one source dictionary, there is
        insufficent evident to overrule OSPD.

gammadion
   =gammadia, +gammadions

   Con: "gammadion" is clearly Greek-derived, so why expect a regular
        English plural?
  *Pro: The documentation for "gammadia" is insufficent to make me
        reject the implied "gammadions".

gastritis
   +?gastritides, +gastritises

   See "arteritis".

gelati
   =gelati, +?gelatis

   Con: "gelati" is already plural.
  *Pro: Not according to several dictionaries.

go
    +?gos

    Con: So what is the plural of the Japanese game "go"?  Is it "go",
         since Japanese itself has no plural.  Or is it "goes", the same
         as the plural of the verb "go"?
   *Pro: In the absence of an explicit plural, "gos" is what you'd
         expect.  And OSW lists it.

grandiflora
   =?grandiflorae, =grandifloras

   Con: "grandiflora" is a species name, and such names only
        infrequently have Latinate plurals.  Given the lack of
        documentation for "grandiflorae", the logical assumption is
        that only "grandifloras" is used.
  *Pro: "flora" pluralizes as "florae" as well as "floras".  So why
        shouldn't "grandiflora" follow the pattern?

gravlax
   =gravlax, !?gravlaxes

   Pro: None of the non-OSPD sources indicate that "gravlax" is plural,
        and OSW lists "gravlaxes".
  *Con: In the definition of "gravlax" ("smoked salmon"), "salmon"
        itself is plural.  How much more explicit do you need to
        be?

hao
   =hao, !?haos

   Pro: Neither RHWCD nor AH give an explicit plural for "hao".  Since
        "hao" is a currency, this is enough justification to list it
        (see "pula").
  *Con: All other listed Vietnamese currencies are self-plural.  And
        both RHWCD and AH, despite failing to specify a plural in their
        definitions, use "hao" as a plural in their currency tables.

hypermedia
   =hypermedia, +?hypermedias

   Con: "media" is plural, so is "hypermedia".
  *Pro: MW10's rather strange definition of "hypermedia" ("a database
        format") is clearly singular, with a meaningful plural.

inion
   =inia, +?inions

   Con: "inion" is an anatomical term, and should have a Latinate plural.
        OSPD says it does.  What's the problem?
  *Pro: Only OSPD and OSW show the Latinate plural.  Everyone else,
        including MW Medical, fails to mention it.  Especially since
        "inion" doesn't look particularly foreign, this is most likely
        intended to indicate a regular plural.

jackanapes
   =jackanapes, =?jackanapeses

   Con: "jackanapeses"?  Aw, come on, pull the other one.
  *Pro: "jackanapeses" is recognized by the Hasbro Scrabble game, and
        only one source dictionary (Encarta (r)) contradicts this.  A
        very close call.

jailbait
   =jailbait, !?jailbaits

   Pro: "jailbait" means "a girl under the age of consent".  This clearly
        has a meaningful plural.  In the absence of contrary information,
        that plural must be "jailbaits".
  *Con: "bait", in the sense of "food used as a fishing lure", is a
        collective noun.  We speak of buying "bait", not "baits".
        "jailbait" is derived from this usage of "bait".  Besides, can
        anyone imagine overhearing "Oh man!  Look at those jailbaits!"

jejunum
   =jejuna, !?jejunums

   Pro: A majority of the ENABLE dictionaries as well as MW10 leave out
        any plural for "jejunum".  While the word is certainly strange,
        it doesn't have the feel that would lead one to assume a Latin
        plural.
  *Con: No one but a medical professional is going to speak or write about
        a "jejunum", much less more than one.  And MW Medical testifies
        that they'll be using the -a plural.

jiao
   =jiao, !?jiaos

   See "hao", replacing Vietnam with China.  (Since "jiao" is not listed
   in MW10's currency table, the part of the argument about currency
   tables does not apply.)

kenosis
   +?kenoses, =kenosises

   See "mimesis".  It should be noted that it is almost impossible to
   imagine a circumstance where "kenosis" might be used in the plural.

lez
   !?lezes, =lezzes

   Pro: "lezes" is listed by OSW, and implied by WNW.  Additionally, the
        plural of the variant spelling "les" is "leses", since "lesses" is
        clearly wrong.
  *Con: "lezzes" has more support, and is a far more sensible spelling.

lochia
   =lochia, +?lochias

   Con: OSPD and The MW Medical Dictionary agree that "lochia" is its
        own plural.  Isn't that enough?
  *Pro: But none of the primary dictionaries that actually list
        "lochia" support this conclusion.

logos
   =logoi, !?logoses

   Pro: Besides OSPD, the only actual evidence for "logoi" is in
        MW10 which, since it capitalizes "Logos", is irrelevant.
  *Con: "logos" is a Greek word used as a technical term used in
        philosophy and theology.  One expects a Greek plural, and one
        assumes that anyone erudite enough to actually use the word will
        recognize that.  Besides, "logoses" is awkward.  Another very
        close call.

lordosis
   =lordoses, !?lordosises

   Pro: "lordosis" is not an -osis in the usual way the suffix is
        used.  A majority of the source dictionaries give no explicit
        plural, which, in these cirucmstances, is support for a
        regular English plural.
  *Con: A sufficent number of sources document "lordoses" to make
        "lordosises" rather unlikely.

malines
   =malines, !?malineses

   Pro: "malines" is a fabric, it should have a plural.  And no
        source dictionary shows it as its own plural.
  *Con: The "s" in "malines" is silent.  Given that, is "malineses"
        a reasonable spelling for the plural?  Besides which, a
        variant of "malines" is "maline".  I consider it to be
        possible that "malines" was originally a plural for which
        the singular gradually dropped out of usage.

mankind
   =mankind, !?mankinds

   Pro: OSW lists "mankinds", and none of the source dictionaries
        actually labels "mankind" as already plural.
  *Con: "mankinds"?  You gotta be kidding!

metacercaria
   =metacercariae, !?metacercarias

   Pro: MW10 is the only dictionary listing "metacercaria", and it
        implies a regular plural.
  *Con: Three tertiary sources, including the MW Medical Dictionary,
        give the plural as "metacercariae", and it is the sort of
        word one expects to have an irregular plural.

mimesis
   +?mimeses, =mimesises

   Con: OSPD shows "mimesis" as regular, and no source dictionary
        contradicts this.
  *Pro: This word screams for a Latinate plural, which is listed by
        OSW.

muggins
   =muggins, +?mugginses

   Con: "mugginses" is pretty damn unnatural.
  *Pro: It's not all that much worse than "joneses".  And it's listed
        by OSW.  Still, a very close call.

natriuresis
   =natriureses, !?natriuresises

   Pro: No source actually lists "natriureses", including the MW
        Medical Dictionary.  Because MWMD is so consistently precise
        about plurals, this is strong evidence that in fact the plural
        is regular.
  *Con: Not strong enough!

noesis
   +?noeses, =noesises

   See "mimesis".

omphalos
   =omphali, +?omphaloses

   Con: It's Greek, and obviously Greek.  Enough said.
  *Pro: Though I don't know Greek, if "omphalos" took a Greek plural, and
        conformed to the pattern of other Greek-derived -os words in
        English, its plural would be "omphaloi".  For this reason, failure
        of multiple dictionaries to list an explicit plural cannot be
        construed as evidence for "omphali".

omphaloskepsis
   =omphaloskepses, !?omphaloskepsises

   Pro: This is one of the most frustrating words of the 170,000 in
        ENABLE2K, because there is no evidence!  In the absence of
        evidence, we have no choice but to assume a regular plural.
  *Con: Not so.  "omphaloskepsis" reeks of Greek.  Do you really
        think it has an regular English plural?  (Either way, or
        even both ways at once, I'm not convinced.)

once
   =once, +?onces

   Con: It seems that "once" is a noun, meaning "one single time".
        OK, but can a word meaning "one single time" actually have a
        plural?
  *Pro: Sure.  Here's an example:  "We had each tried LSD once, but
        our onces had affected us quite differently."

oyes
   !?oyeses, =oyesses

   Pro: "oyeses" is listed in OSW, and implied by a solid majority
        of the source dictionaries.
  *Con: "oyesses" is a far more reasonable plural, and is adequately
        documented.

oyez
   =oyesses, !?oyezes

   Pro: See "oyes" Pro.  In addition, "oyesses" is a pretty weird
        plural for "oyez".  If it were beyond dispute, don't you
        think that all of the dictionaries would have mentioned it?
  *Con: Yes, there is a strong case for "oyezes".  But if I accept
        it, I have little justification for rejecting "oyeses" as
        a plural of "oyes", even though it seems to me clearly wrong.

panmixis
   +panmixes, +?panmixises

   See "apomixis" and "endomixis".  (One difference from "endomixis":
   OSW does not list "panmixes", but OSPD does.)

parenchyma
   =parenchymas, +?parenchymata

   See "aerenchyma".

paterfamilias
   !?paterfamiliases, =patresfamilias

   Pro: "paterfamiliases" is implied by RHWCD, and explicitly listed
        by RH Unabridged.
  *Con: Insufficent, when compared to the weight of evidence against
        it.

penne
    =penne, !?pennes

    Pro: "pennes" is listed by OSW, and implied by Encarta.
   *Con: Admittedly, some pastas are plural and some pastas are
         singular.  But the evidence that "penne" is plural is
         much stronger than the evidence it is not.

pereion
   +pereia, !?pereions
pereon
   +perea, !?pereons

   Pro: The only listing of these words outside of OSPD is in MW10, and
        it implies a regular plural.
  *Con: You expect a word meaning "an anatomical part of a crustacean" to
        have a regular plural?

pinyin
   =pinyin, !?pinyins

   Pro: "pinyins" is clearly implied everywhere "pinyin" is listed,
        including OSPD (before emendation by TWL98).
  *Con: But TWL98 got it right.  There is only one "pinyin".

pocketful:
   =pocketfuls, =?pocketsful

   Con: "pocketsful" is cited as a valid plural by AH3, but not by MW10.
        Also, since MW10 lists the only plural of the suffix -ful as
        -fuls, "pocketsful" is not even implied by MW10.  Since the main
        ENABLE word list should contain only words from OSPD and MW10,
        "pocketsful" should be removed.
  *Pro: "pocketsful" was added to the list of valid words by the TWL98
        committee.  Where plausible, such changes should be included
        even without support from MW10 (see also "mongoloids" and
        "samaritans".)

postcava
   =postcavae, !?postcavas

   Pro: If there were a word "cava" with plural "cavae", the implication
        of "postcavae" would be strong.  Without it, the failure of MW10
        and AH3 to show a plural must be considered evidence favoring
        "postcavas".
  *Con: There is no explicit evidence for "postcavas" and one expects
        a Latinate plural for such anatomical terms.  Also, "postcavae"
        is implied by the plural "venae cavae" of "vena cava".  A close
        call.

pronephros
   +pronephra, +pronephroi, -?pronephroses

  *Pro: The Hasbro Scrabble game accepts "pronephroses".  While
        this is not the strongest possible evidence, we should not
        casually disregard it.
   Con: The evidence for the irregular plurals is strong, and it
        is likely that the entries showing no explicit plural (MW10
        and WNW) are oversights rather than testimony for a regular
        plural.  Also, there is no particular evidence of a regular
        plural for *any* -nephros word.  Yet another close call.

prosenchyma
   =prosenchymas, +?prosenchymata

   See "aerenchyma".

pseudoparenchyma
   =pseudoparenchymas, +?pseudoparenchymata

   See "aerenchyma".

puerperium
   =puerperia, !?puerperiums

  *Con: A clear majority of the sources list "puerperia" as the only
        plural, including MW Medical.
   Pro: Yeah, I suppose so.  But my intuitions lead me to expect
        "puerperiums" to also be acceptable.  While "puerperium" does
        indeed have a medical aspect, it's not quite the same sort of
        word as "diverticulum".

pula
   =pula, +?pulas

   Con: The evidence for "pula" is very weak, consisting of OSW and
        an omitted plural in AH3.
  *Pro: Currency plurals are one of the issues on which dictionaries
        strongly disagree.  By analogy with other currencies, AH3's
        omitted plural is better read as an endorsement of "pulas"
        than as some kind of oversight.

pyrosis
   +?pyroses, =pyrosises

   See "mimesis".

quadrivium
   +quadrivia, =?quadriviums

   Con: The issue is not whether to accept "quadrivia", which is
        listed by multiple sources, but whether to also accept
        "quadriviums".  One notes that there is unanimity that
        the only plural of "trivium" is "trivia".  Why should
        "quadrivium" be any different?
  *Pro: But a majority of the sources, including MW10, give no
        indication of an irregular plural.  Besides, the Hasbro
        game recognizes "quadriviums", and that should count for
        something.

rapini
   =rapini, +?rapinis

   Con: The situation of this word is *really* muddled.  It is not
        even in the paper OSPD, though there is good evidence it's
        supposed to be.  It's an alternate spelling for "rappini",
        which, according to OSPD and most other sources, is already
        plural, implying the nonexistence of "rapinis".
  *Pro: The definition of "rapini" in MW10 is a singular definition,
        not a plural.  Further, the Hasbro Scrabble computer game
        dictionary includes a definition of "rapini" as a word with a
        regular plural.  (It must be admitted, however, that the Hasbro
        game, despite the definition, does not actually accept "rapinis".)

rappini
   =rappini, +?rappinis

   See "rapini".  The sitation is slightly different, since the Hasbro
   game agrees with OSPD in this instance, but since "rapini" and
   "rappini" are alternate spellings of the same word, they ought not to
   have different forms of pluralization, at least not without good
   documentation thereof.

reticulum
   =reticula, !?reticulums

   Pro: "reticulums" is implied by MW10, and listed in OSW.
  *Con: Not very good evidence compared the rest of the American
        lexicographic world, all of which accept only "reticula".
        A close call.

rufiyaa
   =rufiyaa, +?rufiyaas

   See "pula".

seecatch
   !?seecatches, =seecatchie

   Pro: WNW4 fails to list a plural for "seecatch".  This can't be
        construed as support for "seecatchie", which is obviously a most
        unusual pluralization.
  *Con: Actually, WNW4 lists "seecatchie" as an alternate form of
        "seecatch".  Three other sources agree that "seecatchie" is
        the plural; the WNW4 entry is most easily explained as the
        result of confusion, rather than as evidence for "seecatches".

serpigo
   =serpigines, =serpigoes, !?serpigos

   Pro: More sources imply a regular plural for "serpigo" than list an
        irregular one.
  *Con: "serpigo" is a disease, and there is seldom call to use it in
        the plural.  No more than this should be read from the failure
        to mention a specific plural.

shrapnel
   =shrapnel, +?shrapnels

   Con: No reason to doubt OSPD and MW10 on this one.
  *Pro: In addition to the meaning of "fragments from a shell", an
        inherently plural meaning, "shrapnel" can also mean "a shell
        designed to scatter shrapnel".  This meaning is singular, and
        pretty obviously has a regular plural.  This is confirmed by
        OSW.

skepsis
   !?skepses, =?skepsises

   Pro: We've seen "omphalos" and "ompahloskepsis" - now here's the
        missing piece.  While it's true that no one lists the plural
        "skepses", that didn't keep us from accepting "mimeses" or
        "pyroses".
  *Con: This time, OSW agrees with OSPD, and lists only "skepsises".
        It's still a close thing, but without other evidence I'm not
        inclined to overrule them both.

spermatheca
   =spermathecae, !?spermathecas

   Pro: Three sources imply a regular plural for "spermatheca"; only one
        lists "spermathecae".
  *Con: A "spermatheca" is a kind of "theca", for which only the single
        plural "thecae" is listed.  Someone used to discussing thecae
        would clearly use the corresponding plural for the derived word.

stereopsis
   =stereopses, =stereopsides, !?stereopsises

   Pro: Other than the listing of -opsis in MW10, which shows plurals of
        -opses and -opsides, there is no evidence of any plural but a
        regular English one.
  *Con: "stereopsis" means "stereoscopic vision"; it is unlikely to be
        used in the plural.  This, rather than regularity, is the reason
        that lexicographers don't bother to list a plural.  Given this,
        the MW10 suffix information is the best we have.

supersedeas
   =supersedeas, !?supersedeases

   Pro: "supersedeas" doesn't conform to any of the patterns of self-
        plural English words, and unlike many such constructions,
        "supersedeases" sounds (to me) quite natural.  And only OSPD and
        RHWCD support the "supersedeas" plural.
  *Con: "supersedeas" is an old (15th century) legal term.  A regular
        plural is not especially to be expected.  Still, a close call.

synesis
   +?syneses, =sysesises

   See "mimesis".

telos
   =teloi, +?teloses

   Con: See "logos".
  *Pro: "logos" is not listed in OSW.  "telos" is, and according to OSW
        the plural is "teloses".

triskelion
   +triskelia, =?triskelions

   Con: The issue is not "triskelia", which is well-documented, but
        "triskelions", which is not accepted by any of ENABLE2K's sources
        except the Hasbro Scrabble computer game.  MW10's failure to list
        an explicit plural is most likely an oversight.
  *Pro: Nothing about "triskelion" leads one to doubt MW10's implication
        of a regular plural.  See "gammadion".

tsooris
   =tsooris, !?tsoorises
tsores
   =tsores, !?tsoreses
tsoris
   =tsoris, !?tsorises
tsorris
   =tsorris, !?tsorrises
tsouris
   =tsouris, !?tsourises
tsuris
   =tsuris, !?tsurises

   Pro: Not one of the listings for all these spellings of "tsuris" (the
        most accepted spelling) other than OSPD implies that the word is
        its own plural.  If it were, it seems like someone would have
        mentioned it.
  *Con: Mendel assures me from personal experience that, as a Yiddish
        synonym for "troubles", "tsuris" is already plural.  While the
        lexicographical evidence seems (to me) to support "tsurises", et.
        al., real word usage trumps scholarship, and I trust Mendel's
        expertise.  (Whether his expertise was in Yiddish, or in troubles,
        he didn't say.)

tympanites
   =?tympanites, -?tympaniteses

  *Con: "tympanites" is a medical condition, ending with an -eez sound.
        Such words (diabetes, calvities, rabies, etc.) consistently
        remain unchanged in the plural.  The only source for the -eses
        plural is the Hasbro Scrabble CD-ROM, not a source which, by
        itself, lends much credibility.
   Pro: Maybe so, but why doesn't anyone document this?  Even MW Medical
        implies a regular plural.  The -eses plural is ugly, but it is
        more consistent with the lexicographical evidence than the
        alternative.  This is another extremely close call.

tzuris
   =tzuris, !?tzurises

   See "tsooris", et. al.

varia
   =varia, +?varias

   Con: "varia" is already plural.
  *Pro: According to AH3, a "varia" is a "miscellany", a word with a
        singular meaning which admits a plural.

waterleaf
   =waterleafs, !?waterleaves

   Pro: While the "waterleafs" plural is well-documented, it is likely
        that "waterleaves" is also valid.  Several dictionaries list no
        plural for "waterleaf".  This implies a regular plural, which is
        "waterleaves", not "waterleafs".
  *Con: The listings for other plants whose names end in -leaf explicitly
        list the -leaves plural.  This leads me to believe that, in fact,
        a -leaves plural is considered irregular, and that omission of a
        plural actually implies -leafs.  (While all dictionaries state
        that implicit plurals are assumed to be regular, they don't
        generally state what regularity means.  Usually, it's obvious,
        but sometimes, as here or for words like "whiz" and "yes", a few
        details would be helpful.)

womankind
   =womankind, !?womankinds
womenkind
   =womenkind, !?womenkinds

   See "mankind".
