One of the results of the researches that have taken place in producing
the ENABLE2K word lists is documentation of the deficiencies of the OSPD
(the Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary).   Notably, the ENABLE2K
OSPDADD list includes over 6500 words which ought to be present in the
OSPD, but are not.  During work on the most recent revision of ENABLE2K,
I became interested in the opposite question, namely, how many words in
OSPD were mistakes, that is, words which should not have been included
according to the original criteria by which the OSPD was constructed.

It is beyond my power to answer that question, as OSPD was assembled from
a number of out-of-print dictionaries, such as the Merriam-Webster
Collegiate 9th edition and the American Heritage College Dictionary
2nd edition, which I do not own.  In place of this question, I have
tried to determine instead what words of OSPD have become stale, that
is, are not included in recent dictionaries of the sort from which OSPD
was composed.  After much labor, I have produced a list showing, for
each OSPD word, a contemporary dictionary in which it may be found, or
the absence of any.  Additionally, after haunting eBay for some months,
I have come into possession of the 1973 Funk and Wagnall's College
Dictionary, which was one of the primary sources of the original OSPD,
and which has enabled me to reduce the number of words of completely
unknown provenance to a small fraction of the total.

The result of these researches is the COSSPD.LST file.  This file
contains all the words of OSPD, plus those of OSPDADD.LST and the
OSPD-eligible words from MW10ADD.LST.  Each word is preceded by two
characters, indicating where a definition of (or reference to) the
word is to be found.  The first character supplies a historical
perspecive on the word, while the second character provides a more
recent perspective.  The encoding of this information is described
later in this document.

A summary of statistics derived from COSSPD.LST follows.  I find it
noteworthy that each of the source dictionaries has contributed a
significant fraction of the total.

Note that each category is limited to words not in any previous category,
except where stated otherwise.  (See below for explanation of the
dictionary acronyms.)

Of the 100940 OSPD words,

  . 70861 words (70.2 %) are found in both MW10 and another recent
    dictionary.
  . 3215 words (3.2 %) are found solely in MW10.
  . 7226 words (7.2 %) are found in RHWCD2.
  . 3747 words (3.7 %) are found in AHD3 or AHD4.  Most of these
    (3090) are also found in AHCD3.
  . 3478 words (3.4 %) are found in WNWCD3 or WNWCD4.
  . 752 words (0.7 %) are found in RHWCD1.
  . 5725 words (5.7 %) are found in the 1973 F&WCD.
  . 3329 words (3.3 %) were not found in any OSPD source I consulted.
  . Of the words in the previous two categories, 520 (0.5 %) are
    to be found in EWED1.  The rest are the words I refer to as
    "stale".
  . 2605 words (2.6 %) are inflections of words not explicitly
    supported by the OSPD sources, including inflections for words
    whose part of speech is omitted.  Of these, 1055 are listed by
    NI3.  Over half of the total (1303) are inflections of words
    from F&WCD.

COSSPD.LST also contains 6754 words from recent dictionary editions.
These words are eligible for OSPD but are not present, either due to
oversight or because they were added after the most recent OSPD was
compiled.  Statistics on these words are as follows:

  . 191 words (2.8 %) are from MW10.
  . 1781 words (26.4 %) are from RHWCD2.
  . 1882 words (27.9 %) are from AHD3 or AHD4.
  . 418 words (6.2 %) are from WNWCD3 or WNWCD4.
  . 1847 words (27.3 %) are from EWED1.
  . 625 words (9.3 %) are from RHWCD1.
  . 10 words (0.1 %) are additional inflections of OSPD words I
    believe to be correct, but which are not listed in any of the
    OSPD sources.

The file STALE.LST contains the "stale words" referred to above.  These
are the OSPD words for which no recent source (of the size of MW10 or
RHWCD2) could be found, and their inflections.  A few of these words,
such as "fishbone", "lima" and "unmended", are still current, and their
omission from recent dictionaries seems rather surprising, but by and
large they are extremely obscure, and unlikely to be missed by any but
the most fanatical word game devotees.

The annotations of COSSPD.LST and their meanings are as follows:

   = - Indicates a word found in MW10.  (See note 1.)
   . - Indicates a word found in the Random House Webster's College
       Dictionary 2nd edition (RHWCD2).
   &,@ - Indicates a word found in an American Heritage dictionary.
       (See note 2).
   > - Indicates a word found in Webster's New World College
       Dictionary, 3rd or 4th edition (WNWCD3/4).
   % - Indicates a word found in the 1973 Funk and Wagnall's College
       Dictionary (F&WCD) (first column only).
   # - Indicates a word found in the Encarta World English Dictionary,
       first edition (EWED1) (second column only).
   : - Indicates a word found in the Random House Webster's College
       Dictionary 1st edition (RHWCD1).  (See note 3.)
   " - Indicates an inflection not found in or implied by any source
       dictionary, but endorsed by the Merriam-Webster New International
       3 (NI3) CD-ROM.  (See notes 4 through 6.)
   ^ - Indicates an inflection not found in or implied by any source
       dictionary, and not shown by the NI3 CD-ROM.  (See notes 4
       and 5.)
   ` - Indicates a British variant of an included word not explicitly
       mentioned by any of the source dictionaries.  (See note 7.)
   - - Indicates a word still in the published OSPD3, but which was
       removed by the TWL98 reform.
   + - Indicates a word not present in OSPD (first column only).
   blank - Indicates a word not in any of these categories.  In column
       1, a blank indicates that I could not find the word in any
       historical source (omitting Encarta); while in column 2 it
       indicates it could not be found in any modern source (omitting
       the Funk and Wagnall's dictionary).

Notes:

1.  If a word is annotated with "=" in both columns, it indicates the
word was not found in any modern source other than MW10.  (About 65 %
of the words are shown as "=.", meaning they are listed by both MW10 and
RHWCD2.)

2.  The "&" symbol has a slightly different meaning in the two columns.
According to the Scrabble FAQ, the American Heritage source dictionary
for OSPD was the American Heritage College Dictionary (AHCD3).  In
researching ENABLE2K, I have instead generally used the full American
Heritage Dictionary (AHCD3/4), which is available on CD-ROM.  In the
second column, "&" indicates this dictionary.  In the first column, "&"
indicates the American Heritage College Dictionary, and "@" is used to
reference words listed in the full American Heritage Dictionary, but not
in the College Dictionary.  Also note that this list uses both the 3rd
and 4th editions of the full American Heritage Dictionary, but only the
3rd edition of the College Dictionary, as the 4th edition was not
released until this work was almost completed.

3.  I should probably regard the Random House Webster's College 1st
edition as now "stale", as the last printing was in 1995.  I have
decided not to do so on the basis that many copies are still in use,
and also because this is a very fine dictionary which I hate to write
off.  Thousands of words from the 1st edition were removed from the
2nd, and it is the only "current" source for many of them.

4.  As anyone who has looked at PLURALS.DOC knows, the question of
validating inflections is very complex and vexing.  I did not want to
complicate these OSPD researches further with trying to ascertain the
validity of all inflections listed in OSPD.  Therefore, I adopted an
agnostic policy for inflections.  If a word was shown in a source
dictionary without inflections, I assumed the inflections were regular,
even if I knew better.  As a simple example, I am well aware that the
plural of "fireman" is "firemen".  But MW10 lists "fireman" without
showing an explicit plural, leading me to treat "firemen" as not shown
in MW10, even though the compilers of that volume certainly intended it
to be implied.  This has sometimes had the effect of making some of
the inflections of a word appear to have a different source from the
word itself.

5.  "^" has a secondary meaning.  Some of the source dictionaries
include lists of words with common prefixes, such as "anti-", "pre-"
and "un-", which do not show parts of speech.  Inflections of such
words, regular or not, are shown with a "^" or """ annotation unless
some other dictionary shows the appropriate part of speech.

6.  The Merriam-Webster NI3 CD-ROM is a relatively recent addition to
my collection of electronic dictionaries.  I was interested to discover
during this research how much effect the contents of NI3 had on OSPD.
Many of the stranger inflections of OSPD, such as "sensiblest" and
"enuresises", are to be found there, and nowhere else.  Once I made
this connection, I made a distinction between unsupported inflections
mentioned in NI3 and the remainder.  About 1 in 3 of these inflections
showed up in NI3.  (The percentage is significantly greater than that
if one excludes the inflections of words without an explicit part of
speech discussed in note 5.)

7.  I remember, when the 2nd edition of OSPD was current, that its cover
boldly proclaimed "Now includes Canadian words!"  This led me to suspect
that perhaps it had been "padded" with unsupported British variants of
words.  My suspicion was not confirmed.  I marked unsupported British
variants of OSPD words with a "`", but there turned out to be relatively
few of them (171).  It is more reasonable to suppose that they were
present in some of the earlier editions of the source dictionaries (such
as MW9) than that they were added for marketing reasons.


Mendel and I have occasionally been asked to supply definitions of the
words in the ENABLE2K list.  We have seen no need to undertake that labor,
as, with the exception of the signature words, all the ENABLE2K words are
defined in either OSPD or in MW10.  However, we must admit that we have
not provided definitions of the words in the various supplemental lists,
which derive from multiple sources.  It should now be noted that, for
the subset of supplemental words eligible for inclusion in OSPD, the
COSSPD.LST file helps meet that need.  For any unfamiliar short word not
listed in OSPD, its COSSPD.LST entry indicates a specific current
dictionary in which a definition can be found, all of which are
available online, with the exception of RHWCD1.  (And the RHWCD1
words can generally also be found in the Random House Unabridged
Dictionary, which is available on CD-ROM.)


A final note is an explanation of the file name COSSPD.LST.  COSSPD is
an acronym for Contemporary Open Source Scrabble Player's Dictionary,
which is the name I have given to the collection of words from
COSSPD.LST which do not have a blank (or a minus) in the second column.
This list is contemporary because it omits words from long-out-of-print
sources, and includes words from recent sources such as the Encarta
dictionary.  The list is "open source" because it makes explicit the
origin of its contents; every word can be checked (and corrected, if
mistakes are found).  Because of these two characteristics, I believe
it be superior to the OSPD, both for practical use and for fulfilling
the original intent behind its creation.
