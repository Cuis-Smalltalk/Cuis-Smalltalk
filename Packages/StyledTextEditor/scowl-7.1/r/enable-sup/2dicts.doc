                             THE 2DICTS LIST
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹


The file 2DICTS.LST is a supplement to the main WORD.LST file, for those who
prefer to use a more diverse lexicon of long words rather than one derived
from a single dictionary.  I was led to assemble 2DICTS.LST by the following
beliefs:

1. Diversity is good.  OSPD (r) is a far better collection of words for
game play than any single dictionary.  OSPD is assembled from five distinct
sources, giving us colorful and distinctive words like "brrr", "deflea",
"hangup", "ralph" and "sleazo", each of which appears to be cited in only
one of the source dictionaries.

2. Long words have a different role in game play than short words.  The
biggest problem with using MW10 as the only source of legitimate long words
is the fact that a surprising number of commonly used long words are
omitted, words like "hatemonger", "soundtrack" and "unimportance".

3. The example of OSPD would suggest that the entire contents of one or
more additional dictionaries should be added.  Apart from the fact that
this is a tremendous expansion of the lexicon (and a lot of work) is the
fact that it is overkill, due to the reduced opportunities for play of
long words.  While a Scrabble (r) player might well be able to play
"soundtrack" (and be shocked when it is disallowed), it is highly unlikely
that she would be able to play "strobilaceous", or would think of doing so
even if it were playable.

Accordingly, I decided to construct a list of additional words by adopting a
set of dictionaries, and adding any word which was listed in two or more of
them, thereby hopefully adding any common words left out of MW10, while
omitting idiosyncracies, likely errors and words too obscure to have
attracted the attention of more than one team of lexicographers.

The result of this process is the 2DICTS.LST file, which contains about
16,000 additional words.  I used five dictionaries to build the file:
the American Heritage fourth, the Webster's New World College fourth,
the Encarta (r) World English (American edition), and both the first and
second Random House Webster's College.  I used paper editions of all the
dictionaries, though I also used electronic editions where they were
available.  As it turned out, the existence of electronic editions of
all of the dictionaries other than the Random House made the whole project
more practical.

Observe that I used the full American Heritage dictionary rather than the
American Heritage College dictionary, which was supposedly used in the
assembly of OSPD.  I made this choice because of the availability of this
particular dictionary in electronic form.  I experimented with use of
the College dictionary instead, and found that only a relatively small
fraction of the words previously chosen for inclusion were affected.  I
therefore decided to stick with the full dictionary in order to make
assembly of the list more straightforward.

Some may object to my inclusion of the Encarta dictionary in the process,
either because of dislike of Microsoft, or because this dictionary has a
relatively bad reputation among logophiles.  I chose to use it because,
let's face it, it will become one of the most used dictionaries in America
(and no doubt the world) by virtue of being installed on millions of
computers before purchase.  Additionally, while it certainly is cursed
with a large number of errors, I don't find the error level unreasonable
for a first edition, and most of the errors have no impact on this
particular project.  I found no more than 10 words which were so blatantly
dubious that I was forced to leave them out, which is no worse than for the
American Heritage dictionary.  And, on the positive side, Encarta's mining
of the English of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Caribbean
makes it a source of many new (to me) words which are too good to be
ignored.

This project was implemented in two stages, the first completed with the
publication of the first version of ENABLE, and the second for ENABLE2K.

My procedures for the first edition were as follows.  I first extracted all
the root words longer than eight characters not in MW10 from the AHD3
index.  I then did the same for WNWCD (third edition), and marked any words
previously found in AHD3.  Finally, I looked up each unmatched word in the
paper RHWCD (first edition), and marked each match.  Finally, I added the
inflections of the marked words.  (This description is oversimplified in
one way: rather than processing each dictionary in its entirety, I divided
the word space into relatively small chunks, for instance ver-wap, and
then consulted all three dictionaries relative to the chunk at a single
sitting.)

For the second chunk, my procedures were similar, except that I used paper
dictionaries exclusively, and was aided by having gathered lists of
unmatched words from AHD3 and WNWCD3 for the previous edition of ENABLE.
At this time, I upgraded from WNW3 to WNW4 and from the first edition
Random House to the second.  Because the second edition Random House
dictionary removed a significant number of words from the first, I ended up
treating the union of the two editions as a single source.  This issue did
not arise with WNWCD.  For the second release of the ENABLE2K Supplement,
I performed a similar upgrade from the American Heritage third edition to
the fourth.

Note that the above was a mechanical process.  I did not attempt to include
or exclude additional words on grounds of taste, preference or personal
disagreement with the sources (though of course I was sorely tempted).
There were a small number of cases where entries were clearly erroneous
and/or self-contradictory.  These few entries were omitted, or corrected
when I was completely certain of the correction.

One interesting problem which showed up occasionally in building the list
was determining the plurals of words which are generally not considered to
have plurals, such as diseases, or for which more than one plural is
plausible, but none is explicitly shown in some or all of the sources.  I
made educated guesses in such cases, and it is likely that some of my
decisions can be disputed.  See the PLURALS.DOC file for a long discussion
of the problem of undocumented plurals and how I dealt with it.

I have no delusion that the 2DICTS.LST file is complete, though I believe
its accuracy level to be quite high.  I'm sure that, being human, I've
overlooked some errors, and failed to include some valid words, but I
hope such oversights are few.  Even though I readily admit to the
incompleteness of the list, I still feel it is a useful compendium.  As
the compiler of the list, I would be interested to be informed of
significant errors.  I plan to correct errors of commission, but errors of
omission might not be corrected unless I can systematically tackle all
similar errors.
