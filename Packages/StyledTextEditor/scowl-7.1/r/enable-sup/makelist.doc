                       USING THE MAKELIST PROGRAM
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹


ENABLE2K and its supplement provide a variety of supplemental word lists
which may be interesting or useful for some purposes.  To assist in
combining the lists suitably for a particular application, the supplement
includes the MAKELIST program.  This program is provided as a Windows 98
executable (MAKELIST.EXE); the source code is also distributed, allowing
the program to be compiled and executed on a non-Windows system such as
Linux.

Before running the MAKELIST program, you may wish to verify that it has
not been tampered with by running the md5 program, described in
CHECKSUM.DOC, against it.  The correct checksum for the Windows
MAKELIST.EXE is F345E5E8DD8E7C7415457EFD22479920.

To run MAKELIST, either use the Run option from the Windows Start menu,
or bring up a DOS window.  If you use Run, enter the full path to
MAKELIST.EXE as the program name.  If you use a DOS window, use the CD
command to make the ENABLE2K directory your starting directory, and
then type MAKELIST to execute the program.  In either case, you should
run MAKELIST in the directory where you installed both ENABLE2K and
its supplement package.

MAKELIST determines what to do by asking for user input.  It begins by
asking for the name of the file to contain the output list.  If you do
not specify a full path, the file will be written in the ENABLE2K
directory.  You must not specify the same name as any of the ENABLE
files, as the program will overwrite its input and probably crash.
(One way of avoiding this without knowing all file names is to give the
output file a .TXT extension, as all the ENABLE word lists are named
.LST.)

After the output file name has been determined, MAKELIST asks you whether
specific lists of words should be included.  For each question, an answer
of "y" or "n" is expected.  You can also simply hit the Enter key in
response to any question.  This is the same as answering "n".  MAKELIST
always includes the main ENABLE2K word list, containing the words in
OSPD (r) and long words from MW10.  You will be asked if you want to
include each of the following:

1.  Signature words (SIGWORD.LST).  These are miscellaneous interesting
words that have been added to the ENABLE2K list to distinguish it from
other similar lists.  (See SIGWORD.DOC for more information.)  Note
that some signature words are found in one or more of the supplementary
lists, and will be present in the MAKELIST output file if you choose to
include any of these lists.

2.  New MW10 words (MW10ADD.LST).  These are words present in the 2000
edition of MW10 but not in the main ENABLE word list.  Some of these
words are new to this edition, while some are words that should have
been present in OSPD, but were apparently overlooked.  As with the
signature words, some of these words are present in other lists, and
may be included from these sources even if you reply "n" to this
question.

3.  Stale words (STALE.LST).  These are words present in the OSPD, but
not in recent editions of the source dictionaries (see COSSPD.DOC).
These words are included in the base WORD.LST file, but will be excluded
if you reply "n" to this question.

4.  Additional OSPD words (OSPDADD.LST).  These are words from five
dictionaries (see 2DICTS.DOC for the list) which met the criteria for
inclusion in OSPD, but which are not included there.  Since these are
all short words, adding them can significantly expand a player's options
in Scrabble (r) or a similar word game.

5.  Words confirmed by two dictionaries (2DICTS.LST).  These are long
words (over eight letters) listed by at least two of the five source
dictionaries (see 2DICTS.DOC).  The addition of these words is likely
to have little effect at Scrabble, but may be significant for other
games.

6.  Additional plurals (PLURALS.LST).  These are words the compilers
of ENABLE believe to be valid plurals omitted from OSPD and MW10 (see
PLURALS.DOC).

7.  OSW and Chambers words (ABLE.LST).  These are words from OSW (Official
Scrabble Words) and the Chambers dictionary, used for tournament Scrabble
play in Britain and elsewhere (see ABLE.DOC).  Adding these words increases
the size of the output list by 50%, adding many unusual short words, and
corresponds to use of the SOWPODS list in Scrabble.  If you have down-
loaded the ABLE supplement into the ENABLE2K directory, you will also
be asked if you want to include:

    7a.  OSW and Chambers words which would not be valid in American
    Scrabble (mostly foreign words), and

    7b.  Signature corrections to the ABLE word list.

If you have not downloaded the ABLE supplement, the 7a words will be
excluded, and the 7b corrections will be included.

8.  Lower-case acronyms (LCACR.LST).  These are acronyms containing
only lower case letters, such as "pdq" and "tko".  These words are not
considered valid for most word games, though there may be occasions
when they are appropriate.

9.  Words with no part of speech (NOPOS.LST).  These are words
representing the pronunciation of multi-word phrases, such as "wanna"
and "dunno", which have no part of speech.  These words are not
considered valid in Scrabble, but are probably valid for most other
word games.

10.  Inflections of one-letter words (LETTERS.LST).  These are words
formed from one-letter words,  such as "ps" and "xed".  These words
are not considered valid for most word games, though there may be
exceptions where their use is appropriate.

11.  Upper-case words (not proper names) (UPPER.LST).  These are words
which are not valid at Scrabble because they contain one or more
capital letters, but which are not proper names or acronyms.  These
words are not valid in Scrabble, but may be valid in other word games.
(See AUXFILES.DOC for more discussion of these words.)  If you include
these words, you will be asked whether case distinctions should be
preserved. If you answer "y", the same word may appear in the output
list with different capitalization (for example, "march" and "March").
If you answer "n", the words in UPPER.LST will be lower-cased, and only
one copy of any word will be written to the output list (e.g., the
output will include "march" and "december", but not "March" or
"December").

12.  Upper-case acronyms (UCACR.LST).  These are acronyms which include
capital letters.  (See AUXFILES.DOC for a full discussion of "acronym" as
used here.)  These words are not considered valid for most word games,
though there may be exceptions where their use is appropriate.  The same
options apply as for UPPER.LST.  That is, you can choose whether case
distinctions should be preserved or ignored.

After you have thus selected the input files, you will be given three
additional choices.  You will first be asked if you wish to expurgate the
output list by removing potentially offensive words.  If you reply "y",
you will be asked to select one of three expurgation levels.  If you
intend to expurgate the MAKELIST output, it is very important that you
read EXPURGAT.DOC first, to understand the process and to be able to
choose an appropriate level of expurgation.  Next, you will be asked if
you wish to exclude words that cannot be played at Scrabble due to the
size of the board and the letter distribution.  If you reply "y", words
longer than 15 letters and words impossible to play like "pizzazz" and
"classlessnesses" will not be written to the output.  If you reply "n" to
this question, you will be asked if you want to impose a limit on the
length of the output words.  To write only words of length 20 or less,
reply 20 to the question.  If you wish to have no limit, reply 0 or just
hit enter.

After the program completes, it will report on the number of words
written, after which you must hit enter to terminate its execution.
