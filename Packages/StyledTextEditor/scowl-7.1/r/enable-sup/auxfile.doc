The ENABLE2K supplement includes a number of auxiliary files of words
not generally allowed in Scrabble (r), but which may be of use in
Scrabble variants, anagramming, or other word games.  They may also
possibly be of general interest.

The rules of Scrabble make the following requirements on playable
words:

1.  They must have a traditional part of speech (noun, adjective, etc.),
2.  They must not be capitalized (interpreted in American play as not
    allowing any capital letters),
3.  They must not be abbreviations, prefixes or suffixes,
4.  They must not require a hyphen or apostrophe (or any other symbol
    which is not a letter).

In addition to the words forbidden by these rules, two other sorts of
words are by general agreement forbidden, though they would seem to be
allowed by the above list.  These are acronyms, and inflections of
one-letter words.

Some acronyms, such as "snafu" and "awol" are not problematic for
Scrabble, while others, such as "pdq" and "tko", are.  The distinction
is whether the word is pronounced as a sequence of letters.  For
purposes of this discussion, I limit the use of the word "acronym" to
this latter class.  (I also stipulate that "Io" is not an acronym in
this sense, despite its pronunciation.  This will be relevant if "Io"
(a kind of moth) ever loses its capitalization.)

Acronyms of this sort have generally been listed in dictionaries as
abbreviations, but in recent years, with the proliferation of acronyms in
everyday usage, this practice is changing.  Some dictionaries now list
many acronyms as full-fledged words with parts of speech.  For instance, a
majority of popular American dictionaries list "pdq" as an adverb.  Such
acronyms do not seem to be excluded by the rules listed above.  In fact,
the word "pdq" is listed in printed copies of the OSPD (r) third edition,
though I understand this listing is considered to be erroneous.  The file
LCACR.LST contains all the lower-case acronyms listed with a part of
speech by any of the 5 ENABLE source dictionaries (see 2DICTS.DOC).  In
the absence of better information, plural formation by adding a lower-case
"s" has been assumed.  I have to mention that the acronym "rbi" is given a
secondary pronunciation by the Webster's New World College Dictionary,
which is the same as that of "ribby".  If this pronunciation ever becomes
the primary pronunciation, I will have to reluctantly accept "rbi" as a
full-fledged English word.

(I note, for the record, that the decisions made by lexicographers as
to which acronyms are words and which abbreviations seem quite arbitrary.
Why "pdq" is an adverb, but "asap", which is even pronounceable, is not,
is a mystery.  One presumes that with the passage of time standards will
be developed for making this distinction, and that lexicographers will
do better at abiding by them.)

Another set of troublesome words is the set containing inflections of
one-letter words, such as "ps" and "xed".  Nothing in the Scrabble
rules forbids these words, which are listed by several of the source
dictionaries, including MW10.  Despite this, in practice these words
are never allowed.  These words, which are otherwise self-explanatory,
are listed in the file LETTERS.LST.

Yet a third set of troublesome words is the set of "pronunciation
spellings", which includes "gonna", "wanna" and "lemme".  (The
Encarta (r) dictionary calls these words "contractions", which is
perhaps a better designation.)  These words are clearly not allowed in
Scrabble play, as they have no part of speech.  Words of this sort from
the ENABLE2K source dictionaries are listed in the file NOPOS.LST.  I note
four words which resemble pronunciation spellings, but which are listed in
OSPDADD.LST because they have parts of speech: "gotcha", an interjection,
"gotta", a verb, and "outa"/"outta", which are prepositions.

ENABLE2K includes two additional files of interesting words containing
upper-case characters (and therefore unavailable for use in Scrabble).
These files were inspired by the description in the printed OSPD of
permitted Scrabble words.  Instead of giving a non-capitalization
requirement, OSPD states that "proper names" are not allowed.  This is
of course inaccurate, as not every capitalized word is a proper name
(e.g., "Iraqi", "Napoleonic", "Pleistocene" or "Ritalin"), and not
every proper name is capitalized (e.g., "pinyin", "cinquecento").  This
misstatement inspired the production of a list of capitalized words
which are not proper names from two of the source dictionaries (MW10
and WNW4; AHD4 and RHWCD2 were added for the second version of the
ENABLE2K Supplement).  Actually, two lists were produced, UPPER.LST,
which contains most such words, and UCACR.LST, which contains those words
which are acronyms.  (The definition of "acronym" given above is used
here, so that "SAM", "GUI" and even "RFLP" are not considered to be
acronyms.  In fact, I treat any word pronounced as the sequence of its
letters as an acronym, even when the word does not conform to the
classical definition.  For instance, I treat "Rx" as an acronym, even
though it does not abbreviate any "R- x-" phrase.)

In many cases, it was not completely straightforward to decide whether
a word was or was not a proper name, and doubtless some of my decisions
were wrong.  I included a name if any definition was not a proper name,
even if the most common definition was.  For instance, I included
"Solomon" (a very wise man), even though the most common use of this
word is as a proper name.  Some of the assumptions I made in winnowing
out the proper names were as follows:  Names of languages (both human
and computer) are proper names, but names of religions and ideologies
are not.  Names of holy books (like "Bible" and "Avesta") are not proper
names, but chapters of such books are.  Designations of specific times
or historical events (like "Holocaust") are proper names, but recurring
events ("January") or prophecied events which have not yet taken place
("Ragnarok") are not.  Of course, all these rules apply only to nouns,
not to other parts of speech.  The noun "Arabic" could not be listed,
but the adjective was no problem.  I went strictly "by the book" in this
regard.  "Romansch" is defined as a noun (a regional language of
Switzerland).  From this, one could reasonably infer that "Romansch" is
also used as an adjective, but since this part of speech was never
explicitly shown, I chose not to include this word.  I maintained a
similar pedantic distinction between dynasties (proper names) and dynasty
members (not proper names), thus explaining why "Hohenzollern" is listed,
but "Medici" is not.

Determining the plurals of many of these upper-case words proved even
more challenging than for their lower-case brethren.  Listed plurals
usually represent my best guess, and may therefore be incorrect,
perhaps, upon occasion, laughably so.  For nouns with a final capital
letter (whether pronounced as acronyms or not), I assume a plural
ending in "'s", unless some other plural is listed.  Thus, for most of
the acronymic words, no plural is shown.

I should further note that I assumed that all trade marks which were
not marked with a part of speech were nouns, and had plurals.  This
upon occasion resulted in some dubious entries like "FedExes" and
"Technicolors" in the list.

Even if the upper-case word lists are worthless for your intended use
of ENABLE, they are worth glancing at, if for no other reason than as a
reminder of how arbitrary the distinctions between noun, proper name and
abbreviation (like most formal distinctions in the English language)
actually are.
