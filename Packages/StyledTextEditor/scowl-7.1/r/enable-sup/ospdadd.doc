                           THE OSPDADD LIST
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹

As I assembled the 2DICTS.LST file, I also worked on gathering together
words from the five source dictionaries which met the requirements for
OSPD (r).  The resulting file, OSPDADD.LST, contains approximately
6,500 words from these dictionaries of eight characters or less (plus
their inflections) that are not listed in OSPD.

As with the 2DICTS.LST file, I did not attempt to include or exclude
words on grounds of taste, preference or personal disagreement with the
sources.  There were a few blatant errors, such as AHD4's description of
"boppish" as a noun, despite the adjectival definition and example, and
a few entries which were far more likely to be typographical errors
than accurate reflections of the compilers' intent, such as the listing
by Encarta of "shadkanim" as a plural of "shadkhan".  When how to
correct such errors was clear, I did so; otherwise, I simply omitted
the dubious entries.

I used the techniques described in PLURALS.DOC for deciding on the
plural forms of nouns whose plurals were not readily obvious, when
information from the source dictionaries was missing or muddled.

Like 2DICTS.LST, OSPDADD.LST is certain to contain erroneous words and
to omit valid words from its sources.  Nevertheless, it clearly points
out the need for another revision of OSPD, and should be highly useful
for any who prefer not to wait.
