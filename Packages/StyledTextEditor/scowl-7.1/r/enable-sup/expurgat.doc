                        EXPURGATING THE ENABLE LISTS

The ENABLE2K word lists are not filtered or expurgated in any way.  Words
are excluded only for reasons of form (e.g., o'clock, DNA) or linguistic
affiliation (e.g., bonjour, ubermensch), but never for reasons of bad
taste (quinine), offensiveness (televangelism) or disreputability
(irregardless).

Nevertheless, the ENABLE2K compilers recognize that its lists may have
applications in situations where such all-inclusiveness may not be
appropriate.  For instance, an ENABLE list may be used in a game program
which might be used by children.  The ENABLE2K supplement includes
the MAKELIST program, which allows one to produce a custom word list by
merging one or more or the lists supplied by ENABLE2K and its supplement.
This program offers the option of removing potentially offensive words
from its output, at any of three levels of squeamishness.

It should be noted that the nature of the English language is such that
complete expurgation of potentially offensive words is impossible, even
ignoring the problem that each individual has his or her own standards of
offense.  Many English words have both offensive and inoffensive uses, and
many of these are so common in their inoffensive uses that it would make
no sense to attempt to remove them.  Examples of such words are "screw" and
"fairy".  The best that one can hope to do is to remove words that are
generally considered offensive, and which do not have common inoffensive
uses.

Further, the compilers of ENABLE2K can make NO GUARANTEE that the MAKELIST
program will remove all words which might prove offensive in your
application.  If the possible presence of offensive words in any ENABLE
list is important to you, it is *your* responsibility to check for such
words and remove them yourself, whether or not you use the MAKELIST
program.  And while we have made a serious attempt to determine sets of
words which might reasonably be found offensive, we cannot know the
requirements of your application.  In fact, as the legal boys say, we
disclaim any warranty that this package is fit for a particular purpose.

The MAKELIST program offers you the choice of three levels of expurgation:
Cautious, Aggressive, and Politically Correct.  (Of course, you also have
the option of not expurgating at all.)  A more detailed explanation of
these options is as follows:

1.  Cautious expurgation attempts to remove patently offensive words, but
does not generally remove words which are not universally agreed to be
offensive, or which have significant inoffensive meanings.  (A few words
are so notorious that they are removed despite minor inoffensive uses.)
Almost all of the words removed from the second edition OSPD (r) by
Milton Bradley for OSPD3 fall into this category.  However, several very
familiar vulgarities (of the sort still not heard on network television)
are *not* removed at this level.  This level of expurgation should be
chosen if the goal is to have expurgation interfere as little as possible
with the completeness of the lexicon.

2.  Agressive expurgation removes additional words that we consider likely
to offend, even if they have inoffensive meanings or are held by some to
be inoffensive.  This results in some linguistic anomalies, such as
permitting participles for verbs that have been removed (due to the
offensiveness of their meanings as nouns or adjectives).  We believe that
this level of expurgation is most likely to be appropriate for use in
situations involving children.

3.  Politically correct expurgation removes additional words which are
found offensive by some.  This list is based primarily on the standards
of the Encarta (r) World English Dictionary, which are much stricter than
those of any other dictionary we have seen.  It labels as offensive
many words with which most people seem comfortable, particularly words
associated with mental disability and gender stereotypes.  Examples of
words considered offensive by Encarta include "idiotic", "henpeck",
"crone", "slob", "klutz", "wimp" and "weirdo".  If you, or your intended
audience, are likely to find such words offensive, then you should choose
this level of expurgation.  We find it hard to imagine that this degree of
sensitivity is ever necessary.  But then, I'm an able-bodied middle-class
white American male heterosexual baby boomer; of course, I would think
that.  (I'm also a "slob" and a "klutz", but we'll let that pass...)

The process of removing potentially offensive words obviously entails the
existence of lists of such words.   These lists, unlike the other ENABLE2K
lists, are not distributed in a readable form.  The lists might well, in
themselves, prove offensive, and besides, the last thing we would ever
want to do is to increase anyone's vocabulary of abuse.  We of course
recognize this will not prevent anyone who really wishes to ferret out
their contents from doing so.  Most attempts to sanitize the English
lexicon are equally futile, a fact which potential users of the ENABLE2K
expurgation option should consider.
