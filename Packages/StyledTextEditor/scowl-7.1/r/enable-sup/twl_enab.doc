                           ENABLE vs. TWL98
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹

The NSA updated "Tournament Word List" (TWL98) is the official reference
for tournament and club Scrabble (tm) play.  It is available only to
members of the NSA.  Some time ago, a list purporting to be the TWL98 list
appeared on the web.  Because the TWL98 is not available to non-NSA
members, we are unable to verify that the posted list is in fact identical
to TWL98.  However, Mendel and I believe it is likely that this list is
in fact TWL98.  It includes the publicized differences between TWL98
and earlier lists, and also contains some of the same errors that
characterized the DOOM list, from which the TWL98 list was supposedly
derived.

When we downloaded the purported TWL98 list, we immediately compared it to
the original ENABLE list, discovering two errors in ENABLE, and five
judgment calls where we felt that TWL98 had made better choices than
we had.  Accordingly, the words "discontinuaton" and "discontinuations",
which were erroneously omitted from ENABLE, were added.  Additionally the
words "antidiabetics", "nonabstracts" and "overbreathings" were added.
These are all inflections of words given in MW10 without a part of speech.
However, all are plausible.  Further, "antidiabetics" is listed in the
MW Medical Dictionary, and "nonabstracts" in RH Unabridged.  Whether to
include these words is a judgment call, and we decided to add them.
Finally, as part of the "plural reform" effort for ENABLE2K, the plural
"salpiglosses", for which there is no evidence, was removed and replaced
by "salpiglossises", which was the only plural listed by the purported
TWL98.  The omitted plural "tsutsugamushis", present in TWL98, was added
as well.

The remaining differences between ENABLE (without signature words or new
MW10 words) and the purported TWL98 can be classified into three groups of
words, two being systematic differences, and then a small set of
miscellaneous differences.  These differences are described below.

The single biggest set of differences between purported TWL98 and ENABLE
is the result of the ENABLE2K "plural reform" (see PLURALS.DOC).  Through
this effort, many questionable plurals in the earlier ENABLE (and in the
purported TWL98) were deleted, and a few new plurals were added.  The
following plurals are present in the purported TWL98, but we can find no
convincing evidence of their validity:

amyloidosises
appendicites
appendicitides
babesiosises
bronchites
bronchitides
cellulitides
cervicites
cervicitides
cholecystites
cholecystitises
conjunctivites
dermatites
diverticulites
endocardites
endocarditides
endocytosises
endometriosises
endometrites
endometritides
eneterocolites
eneterocolitides
epididymites
epididymitides
fibrosites
fibrositides
folliculites
folliculitides
gingivites
gingivitides
hallucinosises
heterozygosises
homozygosises
hyperhidrosises
laryngites
laryngitises
leatherleafs
leukocytosises
lymphanites
lymphanitides
lymphocytosises
mastoidites
mastoiditises
myelofibrosises
myocarsites
myocarsitides
myxomatosises
pediculosises
pericardites
pericarditises
periostites
periostitides
peritonites
peritonitides
pneumonites
pneumonitides
pollenosises
pollinosises
prediabeteses
premaxillas
prostatites
prostatitides
saccharomyceses
salpingites
salpingitides
scintillae
spondylites
spondylitides
tendinites
tendinitides
tendonites
tendonitides
thyroidites
thyroiditides
tonsillites
tonsillitides
tracheites
tracheitides
trichinosises
tympaniteses
urethrites
urethritides
vaginitises
valvulites
valvulitides

Similarly, the following plurals were added to ENABLE, but are not present
in the purported TWL98:

arteritises
carditides
gastritises
uveitides
vaginitides

The other systematic source of differences between the purported TWL98 and
ENABLE has to do with the "also called" words (see DOOM_ENA.DOC).  When
ENABLE was first released, one of its innovations was to add all the words
from MW10 referenced from other entries using a phrase like "also called
elliptical".  These words are generally present in the purported TWL98 as
well as in ENABLE, but the purported TWL98 tends to omit the plurals of
"also-called" words which are nouns.  Accordingly, the following plurals
are present in ENABLE, but left out of the purported TWL98:

diamondbacks
ellipticals
exponentials
greaseproofs
hypoglossals
incandescents
trigeminals


Finally, we have a collection of miscellaneous differences between the two
lists.  An annotated list of these differences follows.  A word preceded
by a + is present in ENABLE but not in the purported TWL98, and the
opposite for a word preceded by a -.

+anticolonials - "anticolonial" is listed by MW10 without a part of
     speech.  Random House Unabridged calls "anticolonial" a noun,
     justifying the inclusion of a plural.
+antisubversives - MW10 lists no part of speech for "antisubversive".
     While there is no evidence one way or the other, we find the
     existence of a plural very plausible.
-antitakeovers - Again, no part of speech is listed.  We find this plural
     implausible, and chose not to include it, despite a citation by RH
     Unabridged.
-bassett - This word was added to ENABLE as a result of the TWL98
     announcement, as an "also called" word, referenced from the MW10
     entry for "basset hound".  The extra "t" was always a little
     puzzling.  The most recent edition of MW10 corrects the entry to
     refer to "basset".  We have therefore removed "bassett" and its
     plural.
-bassetts - See above.
+chlorenchymata - There are a number of "-enchyma" words in MW10, none of
     which is given an explicit plural.  TWL98 uses the plural form
     -enchymata for some of them but not for others.  In the absence of
     hard evidence, we have chosen to list this form for all such words.
+grandstanded - The correct past tense of "grandstand".
-grandstood - An absurd past tense of "grandstand".
+hypoglycemics - "hypoglycemic" is listed as a noun in MW10.
+interwrought - An implied past tense of "interwork".
-kafkaesque - This word is capitalized in MW10, and is rightfully not
     present in ENABLE2K.
+mediterranean - Listed in MW10.
-nonconcurrents - "nonconcurrent" is listed by MW10 without a part of
     speech.  We consider this plural unconvincing and have chosen to
     omit it, despite a citation by RH Unabridged.
+parenchymata - Another -enchyma plural (see above).
-potshotted - A ridiculous past tense for "potshot", directly contradicted
     by both the MW10 entry and by OSPD (tm).
+predischarged - "predischarge" is listed in MW10 without a part of speech.
     We have given it verb tenses, based on the entry in RH Unabridged.
+predischarging - See above.
-preluncheons - This is plausible, but "predinners" was removed from the
     acceptable word list by the official TWL98 changes.  If "predinners"
     is invalid, then "preluncheons" is as well.
+premarketings - "premarketing" is listed by MW10 without a part of
     speech.  We believe it to be a noun, and have included a plural.
     The situation is confused because the original TWL98 announcements
     claimed that "premarketing" should be removed, despite its inclusion
     in MW10.
-schmaltzier - We believe "schamltzier" and "schmaltziest" to be valid
     words.  However, they cannot be justified on the basis of MW10.  We
     therefore omit them from the ENABLE list proper, and have added them
     as "signature words".
-schmaltziest - See above.
-superheavies - "superheavy" is listed by MW10 without a part of speech.
     We see no reason to suppose it should be considered a noun.
-superjumbos - Similarly, we have no reason to imagine that "superjumbo"
     is considered a noun.
+trapeziums - Listed in MW10.
-ultrarights - Removed from ENABLE by analogy with the official TWL98's
     rejection of "ultralefts".
-uncoatings - "uncoating" is listed by MW10 without a part of speech.  We
     find this plural quite implausible, and can find no evidence that
     "uncoating" is accepted as a noun.


[It should be noted that the TWL98 addition of "starfruit" and
"starfruits" was based on an error in the definition of the word
"carambola" which has been corrected in the most recent editions of
MW10.  These words will be removed from the ENABLE2K list the next time
it is revised.]
