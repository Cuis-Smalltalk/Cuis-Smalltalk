                           THE MW10ADD WORD LIST
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹


The Merriam-Webster's Collegiate dictionary, tenth edition, generally
referred to as MW10, is by far the most significant English dictionary for
the American Scrabble (r) player.  It is the only source for long words
(more than 8 letters) permitted in tournament Scrabble play.  Additionally,
it is one of the source dictionaries from which OSPD (r), the authority for
short words in tournament play, was compiled.  It should be noted that,
even though the name MW10 is cited as if it defined a unique reference,
revisions of MW10 are printed regularly, generally with a number of new
words added each printing.  But because the OSPD is also published by
Merriam-Webster, OSPD has done a far better job of tracking changes to
MW10 than for any other of the source dictionaries.  (We have identified
over 4000 words from the other source dictionaries eligible for but
omitted from OSPD.  The ENABLE2K supplement includes the file OSPDADD.LST,
which lists these words, together with eligible words from the Encarta (r)
World English Dictionary, which is not an OSPD source dictionary.)

Despite the above, we have identified about 250 words listed in or implied
by the 1999 edition of MW10 which are not in OSPD or, as far as we can
tell, in the TWL98 list which governs tournament Scrabble play.  These
words have all been added to the ENABLE WORD.LST; additionally, we have
listed them in the file MW10ADD.LST.  These words fall into three classes.

One class is composed of words which have been added to MW10 since
1998.  This includes words like "ecoterrorist", "velociraptor" and "tyiyn"
(a currency unit of Kyrgyzstan).  We feel safe in predicting that whenever
the official word list for tournament Scrabble is revised, whether via a
revision of OSPD or a TWL200x replacing TWL98, these words will be on it.

Another class of MW10ADD.LST words is made up of words which have been in
MW10 for some time, but which appear to have been overlooked in the
assembly or maintenance of OSPD.  Most of these words are plurals of nouns
which are listed by OSPD as adjectives, such as "gnostics" and "modernes".

The third class of words is potentially more controversial.  This list
consists of plurals implied by MW10, but not listed in OSPD or, as far as
we can tell, in TWL98.  Examples of such words are "inions", "archentera"
and "testatrixes".  These words were identified as part of a larger
effort to identify plurals omitted from OSPD and TWL98, which is discussed
in excruciating detail in the file PLURALS.DOC in the ENABLE2K supplement.
It is also worth mentioning that very few of these plural forms are
explicitly listed in MW10, and therefore that the validity of some or all
of them is open to debate.  This is in contrast to the words in the first
two classes, for which the evidence is unequivocal.

Because of the importance of MW10 to the serious Scrabble player, we
believe the inclusion of all these words in the ENABLE2K WORD.LST to be
completely justified.  However, they are of course not yet considered
acceptable in tournament Scrabble play.  Users of ENABLE who would prefer
to exclude these words can easily do so using the MAKELIST utility in the
ENABLE2K supplement, the UNIX comm command, or, in the worst case, a text
editor.
