The YAWL list, word.list, is in the Public Domain. There are no
restrictions on its use or distribution.

The author decided to release the list into the Public Domain because
it is based primarily on other Public Domain lists by the author and
his colleague, Alan Beale, and applying the stricter GPL to it would
therefore be of doubtful validity.

The author has also released the source code to "anagram" and "multi"
(multiple word anagram) into the Public Domain. He had previously posted
these utilities on the "alt.sources" newsgroup in shar archive form.


Please feel free to use the word list and/or source code in your own
projects.  It is, in fact, the intent of the author that this package
inspire word game software for the Linux platform. If you use any
portion of YAWL, please, as a courtesy, give credit to its author.
