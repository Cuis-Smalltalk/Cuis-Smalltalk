About Optional Packages for Cuis
================================

The Cuis base image includes only kernel functionailty, basic libraries, and development tools. Optional functionality, that can be loaded as needed, is stored in separate code Packages. The Cuis community developes and maintains several dozens of such Packages.

Some of them are included in the main Cuis GitHub repository, at https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev in the 'Packages' folder. These officially supported packages are always updated to work well with the latest Cuis image. They are well maintained, and the code is mature. Loading 'Core-Packages.pck.st' loads them all. There is also a folder named 'CompatibilityPackages' that includes packages intended for Squeak (or eventually other Smalltalk systems), that are not fully compatible with Cuis, but that can work well if a compatibility layer is included. Package(s) including this compatibility code are also stored here.

Other packages are being developed by members of the Cuis community, but haven't yet been included in the main Cuis repo. The reasons are varied. Some of them are still under development. Others are of more experimental nature. But most of them are high quality and really useful. Most likely they will be migrated to the Cuis repo, if authors agree, and we think we'll be able to keep the updated.

The Styled Text Editor project, at https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-StyledTextEditor is also well maintained and always works in the latest Cuis image. It has its own repository because it comprises many files that need to be handled as a unit.

Some of the repos owner by community members, and including packages for Cuis are:
(Note: some of these repos also include stuff that is not for Cuis. But all .pck.st files are Cuis packages.)
