# Cuis

[Cuis](http://www.cuis-smalltalk.org) is a free [Smalltalk-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) environment originally derived from [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org) with a specific set of goals: being simple and powerful. It is also portable to any platform, fast and efficient. This means it is a great tool for running on any hardware, ranging from RasPis and the like and phones, up to server racks, and everything in between, including regular laptops and PCs.

Cuis is
* Small
* Clean
* Appropriable

Like Squeak, Cuis is also:
* Open Source
* Self contained
* Multiplatform

Like other Smalltalk-80 environments (including Squeak, Pharo and others), Cuis is also:
* A complete development environment written in itself
* A pure, dynamic Object Oriented language

This repo is obsolete. Active development of Cuis is at the main [Cuis repo](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev)
