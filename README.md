# Cuis

[Cuis](http://www.cuis.st) is a free [Smalltalk-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) environment originally derived from [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org) with a specific set of goals: being simple and powerful. It is also portable to any platform, fast and efficient.

This repo is obsolete. Active development of Cuis is at the main [Cuis repo](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev)
